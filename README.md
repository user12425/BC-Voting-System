# BC-Voting-System
Implementing Immutable Ledgers In Decentralized Voting System

This project proposes a solution that leverages blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and reliable voting system. By highlighting the flaws in existing voting systems and emphasizing the need for a solution that ensures fairness, integrity, and trust in the voting process.

The proposed framework presents a high-level architecture of the voting system, involving key stakeholders such as voters, Voting Management System (VMS), Identifying Authorities (IA), and Authentication Authorities (AA). Voters can participate in the voting process through a decentralized application (dAPP) accessible via smartphones or web browsers. The system verifies the eligibility of voters through their computerized National ID and allows them to cast their votes securely.

The use of blockchain technology in the proposed framework ensures transparency, security, and traceability in the voting process. Each vote is recorded on the blockchain, making it immutable and tamper-proof. Smart contracts are employed to securely execute transactions and establish a connection between users and the network.
